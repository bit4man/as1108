Arduino library for the AS1108
==============================
Work in progress

Allows using a 4 segment display to display numeric values. Integers, decimal points and negaive numbers supported.
Display must be powered separately from the Arduino

  * CS - to digital pin 10  (SS pin)  (customizable)
  * SDI - to digital pin 11 (MOSI pin)
  * CLK - to digital pin 13 (SCK pin)

Using SDI protocol - check your specs as SDI/CLK pins differ between models. The above is for the Uno.
